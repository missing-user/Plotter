# Plotter

A Data Visualizer I wrote during my high school seminar work about CO2 levels in classrooms. It takes the CSV format produced by my sensor array on the Ardino and can plot it on a canvas. It can deal with large datasets by downsampling it and supports basic zooming.

## Why does this exist?

 I didn't know about tools like MATLAB or matplotlib and was trying to visualize all my stuff with Excel plots. Unfortunately my sensor array was producing so much data, that Excel kept crashing, so I wrote this tool to view the CSV data efficiently. The code is really crappy, but I think it's fun to see how I've progressed as a programmer since.
